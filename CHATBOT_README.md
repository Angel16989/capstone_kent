## Setup

### 1. Database Setup
The chatbot automatically creates a `chatbot_logs` table to store conversations:

CREATE TABLE chatbot_logs (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INT NULL,
    message TEXT NOT NULL,
    response TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE SET NULL
);
```

### 2. Integration
The chatbot is automatically included in all pages through:
- CSS: `chatbot.css` included in header
- JavaScript: `chatbot.js` included in footer
- User info passed to chatbot when logged in

    return "Your custom response here!";
}
