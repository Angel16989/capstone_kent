# 🚀 Smart Login Redirect System - L9 Fitness

## 📋 Overview
The login system now intelligently redirects users to the most appropriate page based on their role, account status, and login history.

## 🎯 Redirect Logic

### **🔐 After Login, Users Go To:**

#### **👑 Admin Users (role_id = 1)**
- **Destination**: `admin.php`
- **Purpose**: Administrative dashboard with full system control

#### **🏋️ Trainer Users (role_id = 2)**
- **Destination**: `trainer_dashboard.php`  
- **Purpose**: Trainer-specific tools and client management

#### **💪 Member Users (role_id = 3 or 4)**

**New/Incomplete Members:**
- **Condition**: No fitness profile OR no active membership
- **Destination**: `welcome.php`
- **Purpose**: Guided setup flow to complete profile and choose membership

**Established Members:**
- **Condition**: Has fitness profile AND active membership
- **Destination**: `dashboard.php`
- **Purpose**: Full member dashboard with workout tracking, progress, etc.
