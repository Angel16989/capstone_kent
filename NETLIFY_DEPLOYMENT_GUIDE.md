# L9 Fitness - Netlify Deployment Guide

## 🚨 Important: Netlify Limitations

**Netlify does NOT support PHP server-side processing or MySQL databases natively.** This is a PHP/MySQL application that requires:

- PHP runtime environment
- MySQL database server
- Server-side session management
- File upload capabilities

## ✅ Recommended Deployment Solutions

### Option 1: Railway (Easiest PHP/MySQL Deploy)
Railway supports PHP and MySQL out of the box.

**Steps:**
1. Create Railway account
2. Connect GitHub repository
3. Railway auto-detects PHP and provisions MySQL
4. One-click deploy with database

### Option 2: Render (Free Tier Available)
Render supports PHP with persistent disks and managed databases.

**Steps:**
1. Create Render account
2. Create PHP web service
3. Add MySQL database
4. Deploy from GitHub

### Option 3: DigitalOcean App Platform
Full PHP/MySQL support with managed databases.

**Steps:**
1. Create DigitalOcean account
2. Use App Platform for deployment
3. Configure PHP runtime and MySQL database

### Option 4: Vercel + PlanetScale (Advanced)
- Frontend on Vercel
- Backend API on Vercel serverless functions
- Database on PlanetScale (MySQL-compatible)

## 🔄 Hybrid Approach: Netlify + External Backend

If you insist on using Netlify, here's a complex workaround:

### Architecture:
```
Netlify (Static Frontend) → API Gateway → PHP Backend (Railway/Render)
                                      → MySQL Database (PlanetScale/Railway)
```

### Implementation Steps:

1. **Extract Static Assets:**
```bash
# Copy static files to netlify-static/
mkdir netlify-static
cp -r public/assets netlify-static/
cp public/*.html netlify-static/
cp public/*.css netlify-static/
cp public/*.js netlify-static/
```

2. **Create API Routes:**
Convert PHP pages to serverless functions or API endpoints.

3. **Database Migration:**
Move MySQL to PlanetScale or Railway database.

4. **Proxy Configuration:**
Add `_redirects` file in netlify-static:
```
/api/*  https://your-backend-url.com/api/:splat  200
/*      /index.html   200
```
