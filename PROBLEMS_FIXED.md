# 🔧 PROBLEMS FIXED - L9 Fitness Gym Website

## 🎯 Issues Resolved

### **Problem 1: All Membership Prices Showing $30** ✅ FIXED
**Issue:** All 3 membership plans were showing the same price ($30) instead of different pricing tiers.

**Root Cause:** Multiple duplicate membership plans in the database, all with incorrect pricing.

**Solution:** 
- Created `update_membership_plans.php` script
- Updated the first 3 plans with correct pricing:
  - **Monthly Beast:** $49.99 (30 days)
  - **Quarterly Savage:** $129.99 (90 days) 
  - **Yearly Champion:** $399.99 (365 days)
- Fixed database to show only 3 active, properly priced plans

**Result:** ✅ Each membership plan now shows unique, correct pricing

---

### **Problem 2: Cannot Access Checkout Page** ✅ FIXED
**Issue:** "Cannot go to the checkout page like it hasn't been linked yet"

**Root Cause:** JavaScript code in memberships.php had incomplete/broken redirect logic.

**Solution:**
- Fixed the membership button click handler
- Corrected redirect URL to properly pass plan parameters:
```javascript
window.location.href = 'checkout.php?plan_id=' + planId + '&plan_name=' + encodeURIComponent(planName) + '&plan_price=' + planPrice;
```

**Result:** ✅ Clicking "CLAIM POWER" buttons now properly redirects to checkout page with correct plan details
